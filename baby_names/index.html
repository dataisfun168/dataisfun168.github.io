<p> In NY state the name "Mickey" isn't very popular. For boys named "Mickey" popularity peaked in the 1950's. This corresponded to the airing of <i>The Mickey Mouse Club </i> tv show. We don't know if the tv show caused more individuals to name their sons Mickey, but shortly after there was an increase in the popularity of the name. In the late 1920s-1960's there were a few girls named Mickey, but for girls the name is even less popular. </p>
